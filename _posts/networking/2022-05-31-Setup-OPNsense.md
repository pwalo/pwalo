## From pfSense to OPNsense  
For no other reason than I got my hands on a hardware appliance and I wanted to see if I could ditch the Barracuda OS and add my own.  As I was already using pfSense in a proxmox VM on a HP DL385 G6 I thought I would take a look at the popular fork OPNsense.  Spolier:  I am pleased and will be sticking with it
